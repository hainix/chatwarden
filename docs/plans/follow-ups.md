# Follow-ups

Things found while building, not yet done. Each one names where it came from.

## Done: `@chatwarden/matcher` shipped obscenity's English word list to browsers (issue #8)

Found building the landing-page demo (K8b, 2026-11-10). Fixed in 0.1.3.

- **Problem.** `@chatwarden/matcher` was built on `obscenity`. Its CommonJS build has no `sideEffects` flag, so a browser bundler kept
  `englishDataset` (obscenity's ready-made English list, which holds real slurs) even though the matcher never used it: the matcher
  builds its own dataset from the term pack.
- **Fix.** The matcher carries the few pieces it used (`src/vendored/wordEngine.ts`), so `obscenity` is a devDependency, used only by
  the parity and version-pin tests. `scripts/browser-bundle.test.ts` and `site/test/dist.test.ts` check that a browser bundle and the
  built page hold no trace of the preset. The site workaround (`withoutObscenityWordList`) was removed.
